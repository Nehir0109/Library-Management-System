# Library Management System

This project is a Java-based Library Management System that allows users to manage library operations. It enables users to add, delete, search for books, lend and return books, provide user authentication, offer book recommendations, generate reports, and perform various other operations related to library management.

## Features
### User Authentication:
Users can create accounts using their email and password or log in to existing accounts.

### Book Management:
Users can efficiently manage the library's book collection. This includes adding new books to the catalog, removing existing ones, searching for books by title, author, or ISBN, obtaining information about available books, and updating book details when necessary.

### Book Checkout and Return:
Users can borrow books from the library and return them. This process begins by providing the relevant information, including the ISBN of the desired book. The system also tracks overdue returns and notifies users accordingly.

### User Account Management:
Users have full control over their account settings. They can modify their personal information, such as names, email addresses, and passwords. Additionally, users can delete their accounts if desired.

### Book Recommendations:
The system provides personalized book recommendations based on users' transaction history. These recommendations are tailored to individual users' reading preferences and borrowing habits.

### Reporting:
The system generates detailed reports on the library's inventory. Users can access reports containing information such as the total number of books in the library.

### Additional Features (Optional):
1. Book Recommendations Based on Transaction History:
Providing recommendations based on the books users have previously borrowed can enhance the user experience and assist users in selecting books according to their interests.
2. List of Available Books for Checkout:
Displaying a list of books currently available for checkout can help users easily find the book they want to borrow.
3. Control Over Reservation Duration:
Adding a system that determines how long users can reserve a book can ensure fair distribution of books and enable users to manage their reservations effectively.
4. User Profile Page:
Adding a profile page where users can view their account information and past transactions can facilitate account management and tracking of historical activities.
5. Book Details View:
Providing an option for users to view detailed information about a book allows them to gather more information before borrowing it.

These additional features can further enhance the functionality and user experience of the library management system.
